## Dependencies

You'll need to install Urubu and all it's dependencies to build the site. See
file `requirements.txt` for the complete dependency list. The build works on
Python 2.7 or Python 3.5.

`conda env create` in the root of the repository. To activate the environment
and run the build use `source activate pinga-site`.

## Compiling the site

Use the `Makefile`:

    make
    make serve

The command `make serve` will start a simple server at the `_build` dir
where the built HTML files are.

to view the site.
Use `Ctrl+C` to kill the server.

and tweaked from the Cosmo [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme.

The Jinja2 templates and CSS are located in the `_layouts` and `css` folders.
